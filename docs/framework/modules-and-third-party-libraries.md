# Modules and third-party libraries

## Modules

To enable a module you need to tell to `composer.json` file where to autoload module's namespace. Suppose that your 
new module will reside in `src/Mymodule` directory, and the module test at `test/MyModule`. 

```json
{
  ...,
  "autoload": {
    "psr-4": {
      "App\\": "src/App/",
      "MyModule\\": "src/MyModule/"
    }
  },
  "autoload-dev": {
    "psr-4": {
      "AppTest\\": "test/App/",
      "MyModuleTest\\": "test/MyModule/"
    }
  },
  ...
}
```

# Third Party libraries

Antidot framework is an open-source ecosystem friendly, and it allows easily to manage third-party libraries or packages 
making use of the [Laminas Config Provider](https://docs.laminas.dev/laminas-config-aggregator/config-providers/) component.

 With Composer, you can install any package available in [Packagist](https://packagist.org/), then if you want to have 
 it available in the DI container, you need to configure wanted dependency in a config file following 
 [the config instructions](/framework/dependency-injection.md).
 
 When you want to add complex objects to the DI container you can take advantage of using factory classes, these classes 
 must be invokable with a PSR-11 container interface as the first parameter, and as a recommendation, it doesn't have 
 to have any dependency in its constructor.

For example, integrating [Doctrine DBAL](https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-dbal/en/2.10/index.html) 
connection for MySQL:

Install it by composer

```bash
composer require doctrine/dbal
```

Create a factory class for example in `App\Container` namespace.

```php
<?php
# src/Container/DbalConnectionFactory

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace App\Container;

use Doctrine\DBAL\Configuration;
use Doctrine\DBAL\Connection;
use Doctrine\DBAL\DriverManager;
use Psr\Container\ContainerInterface;

class DoctrineDBALFactory
{
    public function __invoke(ContainerInterface $container): Connection
    {
        $config = $container->get('config')['dbal']['connection'];

        return DriverManager::getConnection($config, new Configuration());
    }
}
```

Register factory in the [Dependency Injection Container](/framework/dependency-injection.md) and add config parameter to it.

```php
<?php
// See dependency injection container config docs to more info about service 
// configuration https://antidotfw.io/framework/dependency-injection.md.
return [
    'dbal' => [
        'connection' => [
            'dbname' => 'db_name',
            'user' => 'db_user',
            'password' => 'db_secret',
            'host' => 'localhost',
            'port' => '3306',
            'driver' => 'pdo_mysql',
        ]
    ],
    'factories' => [
        \Doctrine\DBAL\Connection::class => \App\Container\DoctrineDBALFactory::class,
    ],
];
```
